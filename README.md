List Formatter README - SCROLL DOWN FOR PROMPT GENERATOR README

List Formatter is a simple program that allows the user to store words in a dataset in the format of ["item1", "item2", "item3", etc...]. The use case for this program is to enter words and add them to lists in this format so that the user can later open the .json file and copy and paste all of its contents to another program for text prompt generation for AI art.

The program has a main menu with the following options:

1. Load list - allows the user to load a previously saved dataset from a .json file
2. Edit list - allows the user to add or remove items from the current dataset
3. Quit - exits the program
4. View loaded list - displays the current dataset

When the user chooses to "Load list" option, the program will display a list of all .json files in the current directory, and the user can select the file they wish to load.

When the user chooses to "Edit list" option, the user will be able to add new items to the dataset or remove items that already exist in the dataset. The user will also be prompted to save the changes made to the dataset.

When the user chooses the "View loaded list" option, the program will display the current dataset.

The program also has a confirmation prompt before quitting to ensure that the user does not accidentally exit without saving their work.

In summary, List Formatter is a simple program that allows the user to easily create and edit datasets in a specific format for use in other programs such as text prompt generators for AI art.
